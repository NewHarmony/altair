Installation
============

.. note::

   Altair version 2.0 requires Python 3.5 or later.
   It does not work with Python 2.

To use Altair for visualization, you need to install two sets of tools

1. The core Altair Package and its dependencies

2. The renderer for the frontend you wish to use (i.e. `Jupyter Notebook`_,
   `JupyterLab`_, or `nteract`_)

Here we will briefly outline the basic installation steps for JupyterLab and
for Jupyter Notebook; for more details, or for information about nteract and
other front-ends, see :ref:`displaying-charts`

- :ref:`installation-jupyterlab`

- :ref:`installation-notebook`


.. _installation-jupyterlab:

Installing Altair with JupyterLab
---------------------------------
This section details how to install Altair for use with JupyterLab.
To install Altair for use with the Jupyter notebook, see :ref:`installation-notebook`.

.. warning::

   conda installation is not yet available for the version 2.0 release
   candidate. Please install the release candidate with pip.

Both Altair and JupyterLab can be installed with `pip`::

    $ pip install altair==2.0.0rc1
    $ pip install jupyterlab

or with ``conda``::

    $ conda install altair jupyterlab --channel conda-forge

For JupyterLab version 0.32 or newer, nothing else needs to be done to use
the main Altair API. For JupyterLab version 0.31, you'll additionally need to
run the following::

    $ jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/vega3-extension

Once altair and Jupyterlab are installed, launch JupyterLab by running::

    $ jupyter lab

This should launch a web browser window. The first time JupyterLab is launched,
you will see a *Launcher* window: Under the "Notebook" section, click "Python 3"
to launch a new notebook. Then you should be able to execute Altair code and
see the rendered charts; to try it out, you can copy, paste, and execute the
following code to make certain everythin is working correctly:

.. altair-plot::

    import altair as alt
    from vega_datasets import data

    iris = data.iris()

    alt.Chart(iris).mark_point().encode(
        x='petalLength',
        y='petalWidth',
        color='species'
    )

Once things are up and running, you may wish to go through the tutorials at
:ref:`starting` and :ref:`exploring-weather`, read through the User Guide
indexed in the left panel, or check out the :ref:`example-gallery` for more ideas.

.. _installation-notebook:

Installing Altair with Jupyter Notebook
---------------------------------------
This section details how to install Altair for use with Jupyter Notebook.
To install Altair for use with the JupyterLab, see :ref:`installation-jupyterlab`.

.. warning::

   conda installation is not yet available for the version 2.0 release
   candidate. Please install the release candidate with pip.

Both Altair and Jupyter Notebook can be installed with ``pip``::

    $ pip install altair==2.0.0rc1 notebook

or with ``conda``::

    $ conda install altair notebook --channel conda-forge

To use Altair with the Jupyter notebook, you must additionally install the
vega3_  package and enable its notebook extension::

    $ pip install vega3
    $ jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --py vega3 # not needed in notebook >= 5.3

Once altair and Jupyter Notebook are installed, launch the notebook by running::

    $ jupyter notebook

This should launch a web browser window. Click the *New* drop-down menu and
select "Python 3".
Then you should be able to copy and paste the following code, and see a chart
within your notebook:

.. altair-plot::

    import altair as alt
    from vega_datasets import data

    # for the notebook only (not for JupyterLab) run this command once per session
    alt.renderers.enable('notebook')

    iris = data.iris()

    alt.Chart(iris).mark_point().encode(
        x='petalLength',
        y='petalWidth',
        color='species'
    )

.. note::

    For the classic Jupyter notebook (not JupyterLab), each time you launch a
    notebook you must explicitly enable Altair rendering by running::

        alt.renderers.enable('notebook')

    If you neglect this step, charts will not be rendered, but instead
    displayed as a textual representation.

Once things are up and running, you may wish to go through the tutorials at
:ref:`starting` and :ref:`exploring-weather`, read through the User Guide
indexed in the left panel, or check out the :ref:`example-gallery` for more ideas.


.. _install-dependencies:

Dependencies
------------

Altair has the following dependencies, all of which are installed automatically
with the above installation commands:

- python 3.5 or higher
- entrypoints_
- IPython_
- jsonschema_
- NumPy_
- Pandas_
- Six_
- Toolz_
- vega_datasets_


Development Install
-------------------

The `Altair source repository`_ is available on GitHub. Once you have cloned the
repository and installed all the above dependencies, run the following command
from the root of the repository to install the master version of Altair:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -e .

If you do not wish to clone the source repository, you can install the
development version directly from GitHub using:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/altair-viz/altair
